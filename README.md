## Description

The Employee Directory is a React.js application that divides the UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. The application utilizes the Random User Generator API to mock an employee directory consisting of 100 employees.

Given the table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user is able to:

  * Search the table for user by name

  * Filter the users by first or last name property

## User Story
```
 As a user, 
 I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 
 So that I have quick access to their information.
```
## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
